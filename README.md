ToDoeZel – React.js

A responsive task management application built with React.js. It extends the original Vanilla JS version with new features, reusable components, global state management, and a clean, motivating design. The app helps users organize their tasks, notes, and shopping items with features like progress tracking, date-based reminders, and persistent storage.

🚀 Key Features

Tasks & Notes (General List)

-Add notes/todos via the ➕ button

-Mark items as complete (✔) to update a percentage tracker

-Delete all completed tasks in one click (appears after 3+ done items)

-Date-Based Tasks (Header & Do Later Section)


-Upcoming or due tasks appear in the header with their own progress tracker

-Clicking the header reveals the full date-specific task list

-Save future tasks in Do Later section → stored in localStorage

-View past 3 completed tasks + all future ones via Show Saved Tasks

-Shopping List


-Simple, clean list for shopping items

-Mark items as checked when done

-Motivational Design


-Dynamic progress trackers that change colors as completion percentage changes

-Minimal, friendly, and motivating UI with custom SVG icons

-Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile


-Modal Window, provides additional information in a focused view


🧩 Tech Stack & Libraries

-React.js – main framework for building UI

-TypeScript – static typing for safer and scalable code

-React Router (imperative way) – handles routing and navigation between pages

-Redux Toolkit – global state management for date-based tasks

-React Hooks – local state handling for Todos and Shop items

-Custom Hook – reusable localStorage persistence logic

-Reusable Components – modular and maintainable design

-Vite – fast build tool and development server

-Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling for responsive design

-SVG – custom icons handcrafted for the UI


🧠 What I’ve Learned & Demonstrated

-Refactored and expanded my Vanilla JS project into a modern React.js app

-Implemented global and local state handling (Redux Toolkit + Hooks)

-Built a reusable custom hook for persistent localStorage logic

-Developed reusable components for better maintainability and scalability

-Designed a responsive, minimal, and motivating UI with Tailwind CSS

-Coded custom SVG icons and integrated dynamic progress trackers with color changes

-Practiced React Router conventions (routing, layout, navigation)

-Applied TypeScript throughout the app, which helped catch errors early — previously I had incorrectly named props that went unnoticed without TypeScript
